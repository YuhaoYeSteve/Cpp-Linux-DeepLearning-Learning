# Learning C++ for Deep Learning AI Projects on Linux

This GitHub project is dedicated to guiding developers through the process of using C++ for developing deep learning AI projects on the Linux platform. The project will start with the basics of C++ development, including how to compile C++ code on Linux, and will advance to using C++ for AI projects, covering areas such as Computer Vision (CV), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and AI acceleration, like TensorRT.
